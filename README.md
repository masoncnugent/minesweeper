# This project runs Minesweeper on the terminal, supporting board sizes from 3x4 up to 1000x1000 with up to 999,991 mines.
# This was my first coding project I've ever made, and the optimizations for it increased its speed over my first imlementation by >100x.
# It allows for winning, losing, custom board length and width, and a reset option at any time. The game tracks your total 'clicks' and time spent to win/lose.
# It took roughly 35 or so hours from start to finish.
