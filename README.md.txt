This is my first coding challenge from Codecademy, with the goal to implement basic python knowledge and use of classes to create a working program. This minesweeper program was made in roughly 35+ hours. 15 or so were optimizations, which brought the total time for large board 'clicks' down by >100x. This program allows for minesweeper to be played in the terminal. It supports custom board lengths, widths, and numbers of mines. Boards can be as small as 3x4 up to 1000x1000, with up to 999991 mines. It handles errors and incorrect user input with no errors displayed in the console. Games can be won, lost, and reset indefinitely.
